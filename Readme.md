
This problem set took forever to finish, I had trouble coming up with how to do some of the exercises
I had to try to come up with my own solutions which doesn't always work sometimes.

In order to run the program. Open the file 'chapter 6 and 7.py' and when you run it,
the program will ask you to enter a file name in, enter in whatever you want and it will print everything in uppercase.
You will then be asked to enter in another file name for the spam confidence, enter in mbox_short.txt
and enter in exactly that, that's the only file that has spam confidence. You will then be asked
to enter in a secret file which is 'na na boo boo'. You will then get a hpefully funny message and then the program will quit.

I made another file called blackboard questions py. and I had trouble getting exercise 3 to run and have tried everything.
